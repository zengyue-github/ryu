How to Submit Patches for Ryu
=============================

Send patches to ryu-devel@list.sourceforge.net. Please don't use 'pull
request' on github. We expect you to send a patch in Linux kernel
development style. If you are not familiar with it, please read the
following document:

http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Please check your changes with pep8 and run unittests to make sure
that they don't break the existing features. The following command
does both for you:

fujita@rose:~/git/ryu$ ./run_tests.sh

Of course, you are encouraged to add unittests when you add new
features (it's not a must though).
